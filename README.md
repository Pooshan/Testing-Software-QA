# UnitTest
This file imports the Room class. Game module so that we can do tests on it. 
There is then a set of tests that are functions starting with test_. 
Inside each test case there's a bit of code that makes a room or a set of rooms, and then makes sure the rooms work the way we expect them to work.
It tests out the basic room features, then the paths, then tries out a whole map.
